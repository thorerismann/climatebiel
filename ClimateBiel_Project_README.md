# ClimateBiel Project

This project is a streamlit application to analyze and visualize climate data.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- **main.py**: The main entry point for the application.
- **app/app.py**: Contains the logic of the application
- **.gitignore**: File specifying which files types and patterns should not be tracked by git.

As the project grows and more features are added, the structure may become more complex with additional modules and packages.
